Ubuntu-based desktop with [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/): a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.

The application presents an XWindows desktop with FFmpeg installed along with codecs available from Ubuntu, normal and restricted. FFmpeg may be run from a terminal or (for simpler cases) using the installed [WinFF](https://github.com/winff) GUI application.
